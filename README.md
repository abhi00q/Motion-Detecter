# Motion-Detecter
The motion detector is my mini project in which we can detect the moving object and capture it.The working is pretty simple:- it record the time that the object enters the webcam, so the video frame  And the time when the object exited the video frame, so now there is a moving  Object in frame and if i go away you see that there's no green rectangle now in  The video. And now i show up again, move out again, and so on. So we're going to  Build this application from scratch using python and yeah we have a lot of  Things to learn such as image processing and video processing as well, and so on.  And lastly what we do then if you press q for quit, what you get is a graph and  As i said the graph will show the times where the object entered the frame so  We're dealing with an interactive graph here and yeah, this are the times when  The object entered the webcam like this one, this one here, and here it lasted  Longer, and so on. This can be a great application if you want to detect objects.  You get throw, you can put this application of this python program in  A raspberry pi server for instance which is a small server and you can put  It somewhere and maybe want to detect animals. You may want to know when this  Animal is entering the frame and whem it is exiting, or with people as well if  There is the case.
